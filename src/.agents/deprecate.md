# Deprecating old Functionality for [CoCalc.ai](http://CoCalc.ai)

Goal: Complete remove all code and functionality for the following:

- [x] payg project upgrades
- [ ] project licenses
- [x] legacy upgrades \(from 2020 and earlier\)
- [ ] Sage worksheets: opening a sagews should convert it to ipynb automatically \(if ipynb doesn't exist already\), then open that. Nothing else.
- [ ] payg LLM purchases
- [ ] all code involving compute\_servers
- [x] dedicated\_vms and dedicated\_disks
- [ ] GPU licenses
- [ ] public projects, i.e., most anything involving an is\_project flag in the frontend
- [ ] jitsi \-\- video chat
