# Deprecating old Functionality for [CoCalc.ai](http://CoCalc.ai)

Goal: Complete remove all code and functionality for the following:

- [x] payg project upgrades
- [ ] project licenses
- [ ] legacy upgrades \(from 2020 and earlier\)
- [ ] Sage worksheets
- [ ] payg LLM purchases
- [ ] all code involving compute\_servers
- [ ] public projects, i.e., most anything involving an is\_project flag in the frontend

There is NO EXPECTATION of backward compatibility or need to retain the ability to display old purchases. This is a clean break with the past.
