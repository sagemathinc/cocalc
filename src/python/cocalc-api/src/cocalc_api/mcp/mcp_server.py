"""
CoCalc MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server - Central Coordination Module

This MCP server gives you direct access to a CoCalc project environment.

AVAILABLE TOOLS (actions you can perform):
- exec: Run shell commands, scripts, and programs in the project
  Use for: running code, data processing, build/test commands, git operations, etc.

AVAILABLE RESOURCES (information you can read):
- project-files: Browse the project file structure
  Use for: exploring what files exist, understanding project layout, locating files to work with

HOW IT WORKS:
- You can use these tools and resources to understand, modify, and manage files in the project
- The project runs in an Ubuntu Linux container with common development tools pre-installed
- Commands execute with the permissions of the CoCalc project user
- All operations are scoped to this single project

WHEN TO USE WHICH:
1. First, use project-files to explore and understand the project structure
2. Then, use exec to run commands, edit files, run tests, etc.
3. Use project-files again if you need to navigate to new directories
4. Use exec for anything the project-files resource can't show (recursive listings, complex queries, etc.)

AUTHENTICATION & CONFIGURATION:
Required environment variables (already set when this server is running):
- COCALC_API_KEY: Your CoCalc API authentication token
- COCALC_PROJECT_ID: The UUID of your CoCalc project
- COCALC_HOST: (optional) Your CoCalc instance URL (defaults to https://cocalc.com)
