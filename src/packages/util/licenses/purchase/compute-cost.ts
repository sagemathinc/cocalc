// implemented.  However... maybe we want a new cost function entirely?  That's
// possible too:
//    - just call a new function for your new version below (that's the easy part), and
//    - there is frontend and other UI code that depends on the structure exported
//      by contst.ts, and anything that uses that MUST be updated accordingly.  E.g.,
//      there are tables with example costs for various scenarios, stuff about academic
//      discounts, etc., and a completely different cost function would need to explain
//      all that differently to users.
// OBVIOUSLY: NEVER EVER CHANGE the code or parameters that compute the value of
// a specific version of a license!  If you make any change, then you must assign a
// new version number and also keep the old version around.
