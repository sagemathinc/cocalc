CURRENTLY NOT USED, but probably will be...

database._user_set_query_project_invite_requests(old_val, new_val, account_id, cb)
 For now don't check anything -- this is how we will make it secure later.
 This will:
   - that user setting this is signed in
   - ensure user only modifies their own entry (for their own id).
   - enforce some hard limit on number of outstanding invites (say 30).
   - enforce limit on size of invite message.
   - sanity check on timestamp
   - with an index as mentioned above we could limit the number of projects
