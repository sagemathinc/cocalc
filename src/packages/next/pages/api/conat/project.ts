/*
This is a bridge to call the Conat rpc api that is offered by projects.
This is meant to be called by either a user account or a project, so API
keys that resolves to either work.

For security reasons this is ONLY usable via an API key -- using an account
is not allowed, since that opens us to XSS attacks.

Here is an example of how this would be used:

key=sk-...02

curl -sk -u $key: -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{TODO}' \
   http://localhost:9000/api/conat/project

The api is defined in packages/conat/project/api/
