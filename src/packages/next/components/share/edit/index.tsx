When you want to edit an existing public share, here's the flow of what happens.

- If you are a collaborator on the project with the shared document it shows a button to "Open the file in my project" (or something).
- If you are NOT a collaborator on the project there are various states:
  - If you are NOT signed in it gives you the option to:
    - Sign in, then start this flowchart over
    - Sign up, then start this over
    - Create a new anonymous project and anonymously edit this content.
  - If you are signed in, it gives you these options:
    - Create a new project and copy this content to that project (and it opens the project in a new tab).
    - Copy this content to one of your existing projects.
      - If you select this, then a select an existing projects, and maybe a directory in that project.
      - Project starts and content gets copied
      - Maybe when done get a link and can open that.
- In all cases above, if share comes with a license (i.e., the CUP situation), then that license gets applied to the relevant project... temporarily (?).
