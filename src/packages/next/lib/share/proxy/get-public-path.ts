/*
Supported proxy schema should be mostly consistent with (and an extension of) nbviewer.org:

`url/example.com/thingy...` or `gist/user/id` or `github/owner/repo...`, etc.

Three options handled right now; anything else is an error.  The path must uniquely determine
what is publicly shared (at some unit), and it's nice if it is useful (e.g., for url's and gists).

- github/cocalc/sagemathinc/... --> 'github/cocalc/sagemathinc'; i.e., the github repo maps 1:1 to cocalc public path.
- gist/darribas/4121857 --> 'gist/4121857/guardian_gaza.ipynb'; here guardian_gaza.ipynb is the first filename hosted
  in the gist, and requires api call to github to get it. This uniquely determines the gist *and* tells us what type of file
  it contains so we can render it.
- url/wstein.org/Tables/modjac/curves.txt --> 'url/wstein.org/Tables/modjac/curves.txt'; path equals the url, since this is
  completely generic and there is nothing further we could do.
