/*
This code makes it possible to start this nextjs server as a
Custmer Server as part of a running hub.  We thus combine together
a node.js express server (the hub) with a nextjs server in a
single process.

IMPORTANT: to use this from packages/hub (say), it's critical that
packages/hub *also* have its own copy of next installed.
Otherwise, you'll see an error about

   "Parsing error: Cannot find module 'next/babel'"

This is mentioned here, and it's maybe a bug in next?

  // WARNING: This webpack init below is a workaround for a bug that was
  // introduced in Nextjs 13.  The custom server functionality described here
  //    https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server
  // which we are using to init this server from the hub for some
  // reasons tries to import a build of webpack that needs to be init'd.
  // I couldn't find a report of this bug anywhere, but trying to make
  // a custom server with conf set to anything caused it, but without
  // conf things worked fine.  Somehow I tediously figured out the
  // following workaround, which is just to explicitly init webpack
  // before it gets used in prepare below:
  require("next/dist/compiled/webpack/webpack").init(); // see comment above.

  // app.prepare  sets app.upgradeHandler, etc. --
  // see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/server/next.ts#L276

    // The following is NOT a crazy a hack -- it's the result of me (ws)
    // carefully reading nextjs source code for several hours.
    // In production mode, we must completely disable the nextjs websocket upgrade
    // handler, since it breaks allowing users to connect to the hub via a websocket,
    // as it just kills all such connection immediately.  That's done via some new
    // code in nextjs v14 that IMHO the author does not understand, as you can see here:
    // https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/23eba22d02290cff0021a53f449f1d7e32a35e56/packages/next/src/server/lib/router-server.ts#L667
    // where there is a comment "// TODO: allow upgrade requests to pages/app paths?".
    // In dev mode we leave this, since it suppots hot module loading, though
    // we use a hack (see packages/hub/proxy/handle-upgrade.ts) that involves
    // removing listeners. That hack could probably be redone better by using
    // app.upgradeHandler directly.
    // To see the importance of this you must:
    //   - build in prod mode (not dev, obviously)
    //   - load the cocalc next landing page /
    //   - then try to view /projects
    // Without this fix, the websocket will disconnect. With this fix, the websocket works.
