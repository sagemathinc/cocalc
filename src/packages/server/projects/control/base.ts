/*
Project control class.

The hub uses this to get information about a project and do some basic tasks.
There are different implementations for different ways in which cocalc
gets deployed.

This module does 3 things:

1. CONTROL: Start/stop/restart a project.
2. CONNECT: Get ports, ip address, and the project secret token
3. COPY:    Copying a directory of files from one project to another.

For simplicity, it doesn't do anything else. It's good to keep this as small as
possible, so it is manageable, especially as we adapt CoCalc to new
environments.
