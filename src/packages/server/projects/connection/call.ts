/*
Use the project hub socket API to communicate with the project.

The supported messages are implemented here in the project:

   cocalc/src/packages/project/servers/hub/handle-message.ts

and messages must be defined as in

   cocalc/src/packages/util/message.js

and they include:

- ping: for testing; returns a pong
- heartbeat: used for maintaining the connection
- project_exec: run shell command
- read_file_from_project: reads file and stores it as a blob in the database. blob expires in 24 hours.
- write_file_to_project: write abitrary file to disk in project (goes via a blob)
- write_text_file_to_project: write a text file, whose contents is in the message, to the project.
- print_to_pdf: tells sage worksheet to print
- send_signal: send a signal to a process -- seems maybe broken?; use project_exec instead!
- jupyter_execute: { input, history, kernel } ==> {output:object[]} or {error?:string}
*/
