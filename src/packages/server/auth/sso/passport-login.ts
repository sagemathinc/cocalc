/** This is called by a passport strategy endpoint (which is already setup) to actually
 * authenticate a user. This checks if there already exists an account, if not creates it, etc.
 * Checks if user info needs to be updated, and even checks if this is actually about
 * getting an API key.
 *
 * There are various details to consider as well.
 * 1. If you're signed in already and you're trying to sign in with a different account provided
 * via an SSO strategy, we link this passport to your exsiting account. There is just one exception,
 * which are SSO strategies which "exclusively" manage a domain.
 * 2. If you're not signed in and try to sign in, this checks if there is already an account – and creates it if not.
 * 3. If you sign in and the SSO strategy is set to "update_on_login",
 * it will reset the name of the user to the data from the SSO provider.
 * Users can only modify their first and last name, if that SSO mechanism isn't exclusive!
 * 4. If you already have an email address belonging to a newly introduced exclusive domain, it will start to be controlled by it.
