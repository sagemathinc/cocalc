Caches queries for a certain amount of time.
Also, if there are multiple queries coming in
at the same time for the same thing, only
one actually goes to the database.

IMPORTANT: This *only* caches a query if the query actually
returns at least one row.  If the query returns nothing,
that fact is not cached.  This is usually what we want, e.g.,
if somebody access https://cocalc.com/wstein/myproject, and
notices that myproject isn't the set name, then they may
set it and immediately try  https://cocalc.com/wstein/myproject again.
In that case, we don't want to the cache to mean that they don't
see the page for a while. On the other hand, if querying for the
project that myproject resolves to is cached for a minute that is
fine, since this would only be a problem when they change the name
of multiple projects.
