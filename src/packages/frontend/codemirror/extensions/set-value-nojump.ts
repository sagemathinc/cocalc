/*
Try to set the value of the buffer to something new by replacing just the ranges
that changed, so that the viewport/history/etc. doesn't get messed up.
Setting scroll_last to true sets cursor to last changed position and puts cursors
there; this is used for undo/redo.

**NOTE:** there are no guarantees, since if the patch to transform from  current to
value involves a "huge" (at least 500) number of chunks, then we just set the value
directly since apply thousands of chunks will lock the cpu for seconds.  This will
slightly mess up the scroll position, undo position, etc.  It's worth it.  We noticed
this performance edge case mostly in running prettier.

**NOTE 2:** To me this "set value without jumping" problem seems like one of the
most important basic problems to solve for collaborative editing.  I just checked
(Dec 2020) and shockingly, Google docs does _not_ solve this problem!  They just
let the screen drastically jump around in response to another editor.  Surprising,
though for them maybe it is harder due to pagination.
