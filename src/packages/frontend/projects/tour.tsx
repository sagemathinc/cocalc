            The core of the projects page is the list of your projects. Each
            project is a separate workspace containing files, data, and settings
            specific to that project. By organizing your work into projects, you
            can easily collaborate with others, manage your files, and maintain
            different environments for various projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a glance, you can view important information about each project
            like its description, run state, the last time it was edited, and
            the collaborators involved. An avatar or a color makes it easier to
            recognize.

            When you're working on multiple projects, the search functionality
            helps in locating projects on your list quickly. By utilizing
            hashtags in project titles or descriptions, you can quickly locate
            and filter through projects. The search box above allows you to use
            regular expressions and negation to further narrow down your search
            results. This allows you to easily identify and remove unnecessary
            projects, as well as start and stop matching projects with ease.

          <p>
            Hidden and deleted projects in CoCalc allow you to maintain an
            organized and efficient workspace by selectively displaying relevant
            projects and removing outdated ones. Utilize hidden projects to
            declutter your project list, while deleted projects help manage
            storage capacity and prioritize essential work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking the checkbox shows only deleted projects. When you delete a
            project, it is only permanently deleted after 30 days so you have a
            chance to undelete it here.
