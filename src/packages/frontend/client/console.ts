/*
Some extra functionality that is made available in the command line console
for debugging and generally working with CoCalc.

For security reasons, only available in DEBUG mode (e.g,. when doing cc-in-cc dev),
not in production.

Security note: not easily exposing this to the global scope would make it harder
for an attacker who is eval'ing dangerous code in a Sage worksheet (say).
However, even if it were not exposed, the attacker could just do
   "conn = new Primus(url, opts)"
and make a Primus connection, and start sending/receiving messages.  This would work,
because the primus connection authenticates based on secure https cookies,
which are there.   So we could make everything painful and hard to program and
actually get zero security gain.

**CRITICAL:** If the smc object isn't defined in your Google Chrome console session,
you have to change the context to *top*!   See
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3275816/debugging-iframes-with-chrome-developer-tools/8581276#8581276
