// Here we revert some of the style changes that antd made.

// This is mainly meant to be temporary, so that we keep the
// overall global bootstrap style.

@import colors

// make the color consistent with antd again, since bootstrap sets
// it to something else.  We want this to be consistent with our nextjs
// landing pages.

// The frame-editor title-bar's "..." popover has a higher z-index than e.g. the "Halt" modal
// This makes the antd modals appear on top of all other elements
// Ref: https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/6467
// I found this ticket: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/31513
// UPDATE: this style hack breaks the CRM's "add additional tables" dialog, and could
// break all kinds of other things(!?).  This is bad to change generically.
// The correct fix, which I implemented for the "..." popover in title-bar.tsx is
//       <Popover overlayStyle={{ zIndex: 990 }}...>
// which makes the popover lower than the modal (which is at 1000 without the hack below).
// Then all other popovers are not impacted.

// .ant-modal-root .ant-modal-wrap
