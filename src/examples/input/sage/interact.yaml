title: Introduction
descr: |
    The decorator `@interact` is a powerful tool.
    It allows you to add interactive UI elements to your worksheet,
    such that a function is evaluate with different arguments.

    Ref.: [@interact](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/notebook/sagenb/notebook/interact.html#sagenb.notebook.interact.interact) --
    but be aware, that this is **not** the same implementation as in Sage Worksheets.
    The API is only similar, so expect some differences or missing details!
code: |
    @interact
    def func(k = slider(0, 10, .1)):
        print("k: %s" % k)
        s = (1 - sqrt(k))^2
        print("s: %s" % s)

title: Symbolic Function
descr: |
    This is a very simple example,
    where the we first define a symbolic function $f(x)$,
    and then substitute it with the variable `x` defined by the interact.
    Both `x` variables aren't the same,
    and therefore the evaluation of $f$ works as expected.
code: |
    %var x
    f(x) = 2*x + 1
    @interact
    def f_interact(x=(0, 100)):
        print 'f({}) = {}'.format(x, f(x))

title: Multiple Sliders
descr: |
    It's straight forward to add multiple sliders.

    The `range_slider` retuns a tuple!
code: |
    @interact
    def func(k = slider(0, 10, .1), j = (-10, 10), l = range_slider(-5, 5)):
        print("k: %s" % k)
        print("j: %s" % j)
        print("l: [%s, %s]" % l)
