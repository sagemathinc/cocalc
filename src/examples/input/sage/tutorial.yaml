title: SageMath is Python with Extras
descr: >
    The language of SageMath is built on top of [Python](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).
    There are only some minor differences and hence you can apply all Python knowledge for working with Sage.

    The only real difference is, that a few expressions are *pre-parsed*.
    For example, `f(x) = 2*x + 1` is valid SageMath for defining a function `f`,
    but that's not Python!
code: |
    f(x) = 2*x + 1
    print f(3)
---
title: Assignments
descr: >
    Assignments are one of the most basic concepts of programming.
    An object is born -- as a result of a creation or as an evaluation of an expression --
    and assigned to (variable-) name for later use.

    This assignment happens with the `=` sign on the left,
    which is exactly like giving the created object on the right hand side a "name".
    Do not get confused with a mathematical equation!
code: |
    a = 5   # giving "5" the name "a"
    a
---
title: Expressions
descr: >
    Expressions are where computations happen.
    These could be arithmetic operations, function calls, or other binary operations like comparisons.
code: |
    2 + 2   # sum of 2 plus 2
    2 == 2  # testing if 2 equals 2
    2 < 4   # is 2 smaller than 4?
    sqrt(4) # square root of 4
    a = 5   # assigning 5 to a
    a + 4   # should give 9
    a == 5  # not an assignment, but a test if a is still 5
---
title: Mathematical Operations
descr: >
    Sage uses standard operators to express mathematical operations.
    In contrast to Python, the `^` is for exponentiation!
code: |
    2 ** 3
    2^3
    10 % 3  # modulo
    8 / 7   # this gives a fraction
    9//2    # integer quotient
---
title: Mathematical Functions
descr: >
    Many standard functions are directly available.
    They produce either numerical approximations or give a symbolic expression.
code: |
    sqrt(9.81)
    sin(6.28)
    cos(pi)
    tan(pi/4)
---
title: Types
descr: >
    A great deal of programming is about organizing data and information.
    A "type" is a specific pattern, defining how data is structured and it a descriptive name.
    Use Pythons `type(...)` function any time,
    to learn more about what you are currently dealing with.
code: |
    a = 5
    type(a)
    a = 9/82
    type(a)
    a = "I am a string in quotes"
    type(a)
    # ... and finally a complicated type
    e11a = EllipticCurve('11a')
    type(e11a)
---
title: Classes
descr: >
    A common way to create types are classes.
    Understanding their construction is not necessary at this point,
    but mentioned for completeness.
code: |
    class Fraction(object):
        def __init__(self, nom, denom):
            self.nominator = nom
            self.denominator = denom
    f1 = Fraction(1, 2)
    f1.nominator
    f1.denominator
---
title: Functions
descr: >
    In Sage, there are (at least) two types of functions.
    A Python-function is defined via the `def` keyword and maps optional arguments to a returned value.
    For more information, [consult the Sage Tour](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/a_tour_of_sage/index.html).

    Symbolic-functions are defined via `f(x) = ...`.
    They are special purpose in the context of symbolic computations.

    Hint: always make sure to define `x` prior to constructing such a function or symbolic expression,
    as a symbolic variable and not accidentally as a number!
code: |
    def f1(x):
        return 2*x
    f1(11)

    # this defines x to be a symbolic variable
    %var x
    f2(x) = 2 * x + 1
    f2(21)
---
title: Symbolic Expressions
descr: >
    A great deal of mathematics concerns symbolic expressions.
    The fundamental building block is a single variable, `x`, `y`, etc.
    It can be defined via `var('x')` or the magic command `%var y`.
    Then, symbolic expressions are constructed by using them as building blocks.
    It is important to define the variables as being symblic.
    Otherwise, the constructed expression is something completely different!
code: |
    %var x, y
    type(y)
    ex1 = (x + y)^2 == 1
    ex1
    ex2 = x - y == 1
    ex2
---
title: Approximate Symbolic Expressions
descr: >
    To approximate a symbolic expression (without a free variable), use `n(<expr>)` or `expr.n()`.
code: |
    exp(2)
    n(exp(2))
    sin(31.41592).n(digits=50)     # number of digits
    numerical_approx(pi, prec=200) # number of bits
---
title: LaTeX Formulas
descr: "To see a LaTeX rendering of such a symbolic expression, use Sage's `show(...)` function."
code: |
    %var x, y
    ex1 = (x + y)^2 == 1
    show(ex1)
---
title: Solving Symbolic Equations
descr: >
    Sage's `solve(...)` function allows you to solve symbolic equations exactly.
    Expressons are automatically assumed to be equal to zero.
code: |
    %var x, y
    solve(2*x^2 + 1, x)
    # second example, two equations:
    ex1 = (x + y)^2 - 1
    ex2 = x - y == 1
    solve([ex1, ex2], [x, y])
---
title: Numerical Solutions
descr: >
    Sage's `find_root(...)` solves equations numerically.
    The optional second and third argument constrain the variable to an interval.
code: |
    %var phi
    find_root(cos(phi)==sin(phi), 0, pi/2)
---
title: Symbolic Differentiation
descr: >
    Symbolic expressions can be differentiated.
    This works either with Sage's `diff(...)` function or the expression's `.diff(...)` method.
    You can also compute the n-th derivative directly.
code: |
    %var x, y
    f = sin(x^2) + 17*y^2
    diff(f, x)
    f.diff(y, 3)
---
title: Symbolic Integration
descr: >
    If the algorithm is able to find it, the `integral(...)` function computes a symbolic integral.
code: |
    %var x
    integral(x*sin(x^2), x)
