# Installing Anaconda


## Changelog

* Started to write down on 2015-12-28, hopefully helpful for the next time.
* Maintained and working well at least until 2016-10

TODO: transform this into a `setup_anaconda.sh` file (similar to the `update_anaconda.sh` in `scripts`)

## Setup

1. https://www.continuum.io/downloads
1. linux, python 3.5, 64-bit

on computeX

1. download into ~/tmp/
1. then:
```
    sudo su
    umask 002
    bash Anaconda{installation filename}.sh
    # install directory must not exist beforehand, I'll put it into `/projects/anaconda3` ... IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO MOVE THE DIR LATER ON (rpath FTW?)
    cd /projects
    chown -R salvus:salvus anaconda3
    exit # ... such that you are salvus again
    cd anaconda3
```


OK, that looks good, numba, ipython, jupyter, etc. are installed.

## activate the environment

1. inside /projects/anaconda3: `. bin/activate root`
where root just stands for the base environment of anaconda (not the root user)

1. to exit the environment: `. deactivate`

## Regularly update Anaconda:

1. activate the environment (see above)
1. `umask 002`
1. Update the conda package manager itself: `conda update conda`
1. Now update everything: `conda update --all`
## Anaconda Channels

**.condarc**

at 2016-07-12 for setting up the env in the external volume for the smc-project containers, it was:

    > cat .condarc
    channels:
      - amueller
      - vpython
      - ioos
      - omnia
      - Unidata
      - jjhelmus
      - juanlu001
      - obspy
      - bokeh
      - r
      - mro
      - bioconda
      - pypi
      - plotly
      - conda-forge
      - mutirri
      - defaults
    show_channel_urls: True

## installing additional packages

* http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs
* additional ones via pip3 or so (once you are inside the anaconda environment, they'll be installed inside of it, too!)

1. activate the environment (see above)
1. `umask 002`

       conda install -y basemap bcolz blist boost bsdiff4 btrees bz2file  cherrypy chest cloudpickle coverage cssselect csvkit cubes cvxopt cymem dask distributed xarray datrie db dill django docopt toolz cytoolz datashader python-symengine pymc gdal

not possible to install (conflict with python 3.5):

    pyamg, opencv, mercurial, ... ?

## CLEANUP!

    conda clean --all --yes

## **(!!!)** uninstall boto

(clashes with system wide boto in /usr/share) -- this was pre-containerization, so that's maybe not useful any more

    conda uninstall -y boto

## kernel.json file

To make Anaconda3 available in the jupyter notebook, it does need to know about it in such a kernel.json file. (next to it should be some icon graphics files, too)

**important** the paths in `env` need to be pointing to the correct python installation paths:


    /projects/sage/jupyter/kernels/anaconda3 >> cat kernel.json
    {
     "display_name": "Anaconda 3",
     "argv": [
      "/projects/anaconda3/bin/python3",
      "-E",
      "-m",
      "ipykernel",
      "-f",
      "{connection_file}"
     ],
     "language": "python",
     "env":{
        "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" : "/projects/anaconda3/lib",
        "PYTHONPATH" : "/projects/anaconda3/lib/python3.5:/projects/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages",
        "PYTHONHOME" : "/projects/anaconda3/lib/python3.5"
     }
    }

## PIP3 Packages

This is a list of additional packages, which aren't already part of anaconda 3, but they are mentioned in build.py for being installed into the sagemath environment. Of course, they need to work with python3 and hence install them via `pip install ...` inside the anaconda environment (`which pip` should give anacondas')

```
pip3 = [
    'scikits.bootstrap',
    'mahotas',
]
```

### older install notes:

To learn about them, do `anaconda search -t conda PACKAGENAMEPATTERN` and then `anaconda show â€¦` as told in the output string.

    conda install -y --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/andreas-h shapely
    conda install -y --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/omnia munkres
    conda install -y --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/IOOS oct2py


### fix permissions (umask 022 not always works)

    chmod a+r -R . || true
    find . -perm /u+x -execdir chmod a+x {} \; || true
