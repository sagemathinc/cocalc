# we are experiencing daily stacktraces in dmesg about
# "page allocation failure: order:0, mode:0x120"
# my hope is, and following a few websites about this,
# that increasing the free memory and zone_reclaim_mode helps with that error

# default only a few kb

# this even says ~5% of main memory, and it's a "per core" setting: so this is 2^20/4
# increasing the min_free_kbytes, because cache is still very small.

# we switch to a model, where we do not want to have swap at all

# removing swap and increasing the ratio to almost 100 should give the same overcommit value (right?)
