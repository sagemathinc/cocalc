title: Embedded Help
descr: |
    Sage has extensive built-in documentation, accessible by typing the name of a function or a constant
    (for example), followed by a question mark:

    ```
    log2?
    ```
code: log2?

    It's also possible to use the `help(...)` function.
code: help(log2)

title: Tab-Completion
descr: |
    To learn more about possible operations on an object or existing functions and classes,
    first type in the variable, then a dot, and then press the [`TAB` key](https://www.google.at/search?q=tab+key).

    The tab key can either autocomplete your current input at the position of the cursor,
    or give you a list of possible completions.

    In the given example here, position the cursor after the dot and press the `[TAB]` key.

    Autocompletion also works for partial strings and pre-defined objects.
    In the second and third example, you can either all implemented Graphs or tab-complete a specific function.
code: |
    # press the tab key after placing the cursor right next to the "."
    %var x
    ex = 2*x/sin(x)
    ex.
    # for implemented graphs
    graphs.
    # or place the cursor after "Group" and press tab
    Group
