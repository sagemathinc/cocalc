###
This is a TEMPLATE for making new editors.  Copy this file to editor_type.cjsx,
and also copy the template-related entries in editor.coffee.

Test this by making a file that ends with .sage-template.

FUTURE:

  - show how to open a syncstring file
  - show how to connect to a syncdb database backed by the file, so store is sync'd across users of the file
  - eliminate as much boilerplate as possible
  - make it so requiring this file sets any hooks in editor.coffee, so that editor.coffee doesn't have to edited at all!
