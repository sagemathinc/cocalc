# 1. render the component (rendering step is defined in the billing.cjsx file) into the webapp-lib folder
# 2. during the "webpack" step, this component is included into a full html page via includes
# look into policies/pricing.html, there is <%= require('html?conservativeCollapse!./_static_pricing_page.html') %>

# there is a global window object, which is undefined in node.js' world -- we mock it and hope for the best.
