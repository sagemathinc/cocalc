              course management file. Course packages start immediately after
              purchase, last for the indicated period, and do{" "}

          <h4>Basic, Standard or Premium?</h4>
          <p>
            Our basic plan works well for cases where you are only doing small
            computations in a single notebook/worksheet or just need internet
            access and better hosting uptime.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we find that many data and computational science courses
            run better with the additional RAM and CPU found in the standard or
            premium plans.
          </p>
          <h4>Custom Course Plans</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to the plans listed on this page, we offer the following
            on a custom basis:
          </p>
          <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "20px" }}>
            <li>start on a specified date after payment</li>
            <li>customized duration</li>
            <li>customized number of students</li>
            <li>bundle several courses with different start dates</li>
            <li>
              transfer upgrades from purchasing account to course administrator
              account
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To learn more about these options, email us at <HelpEmailLink />{" "}
            with a description of your specific requirements.
