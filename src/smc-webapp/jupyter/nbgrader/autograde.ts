The function create_autograde_ipynb takes the instructor and student
stripped ipynb file content (as a string), parses it as JSON and
produces the contents of an autograde.ipynb, which is exactly the notebook
that needs to get run linearly somewhere in order to autograde the
student's work.  Once autograde.ipynb is run straight through, the
relevant output can be extracted from autograde.ipynb and inserted
into student_ipynb to give feedback to the student, provide grades,
etc.

The point of this is to ensure that any weird changes (e.g., to the
kernel, test code, etc.) by the student is *ignored* (not just fixed,
but we never even look at it).  Also, all the extra instructor
tests get run.  We do leave in all other code that the student wrote,
because that may be important for defining variables and functions
that get used in testing.

/* Comment/rant:

As of Sept 20, 2020: here's what the official nbgrader docs say about autograder test cells:

> "Test cells should contain assert statements (or similar). When run through
nbgrader autograde (see Autograde assignments), the cell will pass if no
errors are raised, and fail otherwise. You must specify the number of points
that each test cell is worth; then, if the tests pass during autograding,
students will receive the specified number of points, and **otherwise will
receive zero points**." https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/creating_and_grading_assignments.html#autograder-tests-cells

The official nbgrader source code [here](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader/blob/master/nbgrader/utils.py#L97):

```
        # for code cells, we look at the output. There are three options:
        # 1. output contains an error (no credit);
        # 2. output is a value greater than 0 (partial credit);
        # 3. output is something else, or nothing (full credit).
        for output in cell.outputs:
            # option 1: error, return 0
            if output.output_type == 'error' or output.output_type == "stream" and output.name == "stderr":
                return 0, max_points
            # if not error, then check for option 2, partial credit
            if output.output_type == 'execute_result':
                # is there a single result that can be cast to a float?
                partial_grade = get_partial_grade(output, max_points, log)
                return partial_grade, max_points

        # otherwise, assume all fine and return all the points
        return max_points, max_points

...
        warning_msg = """For autograder tests, expecting output to indicate partial
        credit and be single value between 0.0 and max_points. Currently treating other
        output as full credit, but future releases may treat as error.""""
```

As far as I can tell, the octave kernel doesn't create stderr or error
output_types when there is an assertion failure. So it seems like the Octave
kernel is unusable with this.  Octave does this:
```
   "name": "stdout",
   "output_type": "stream",
     "text": [
      "error: No Answer Given!...]
```

So here are CoCalc's rules:

  - same as nbgrader, except if there is "error" in the output
  - then different.

Also, we do NOT stop checking for errors in output even if there is partial credit
output, since that seems like a possible way students can cheat (!?)
