        p.
          You no longer have to worry about setting up your Python environment, installing/updating/maintaining your libraries, or backing up files.

            #{NAME}'s Jupyter Notebooks fully support #[strong automatic grading]!
            The teacher's notebook contains exercise cells for students and test cells, some of which students can also run to get immediate feedback.
            Once collected, you tell #{NAME} to automatically run the full test suite across all student notebooks and tabulate the results.

            You are also notified about the presence of watching collaborators.

            Even sliders, menus and knobs of
            #[a(href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html") interactive widgets]
            are synchronized among all collaborators.
          div.
            Additionally, the status and results of all computations in the currently running kernel session are also synchronized,
            because the session runs remotely in #{NAME}'s cluster.
          div.
            Together, everyone involved experiences the document in exactly the same way.

            The #[strong #[a(href="https://doc.cocalc.com/time-travel.html") Time-travel feature]] is specific to the #{NAME} platform.
            It records all your changes in the Jupyter notebook in fine detail.
            You can go back and forth in time across hundreds of changes to recover your previous edits.
          div.
            This allows you to easily recover parts of previous versions of your file,
            by copy/pasting the part you accidentally changed.
          div.
            You can also relive the entire process of creating the notebook from the start.
            This lets you discover how you arrived at a particular solution and see what you (or your student) tried before.

            #{NAME} offers a #[strong complete rewrite] of the classical #[a(href="http://jupyter.org/") Jupyter notebook] interface.
            It is tightly integrated into #{NAME} and adds real-time collaboration,
            time-travel history and
            #[a(href="http://blog.sagemath.com/jupyter/2017/05/05/jupyter-rewrite-for-smc.html") more].
          div.
            This rewrite does not change the underlying Jupyter notebook file format.
            Therefore, you can download your #[code *.ipynb] file at any time and continue working in another environment.
          div.
            Despite that, there is also support for the "Classical notebook".
            This assures that you can still use all libraries relying on the specifics of that implementation.
            #{NAME} does add collaborative editing and a chat, too.

            Long running notebook sessions or intense computations might deplete available CPU or memory resources.
            This slows down all calculations or even causes an unexpected termination of the current session.

            This means you can always recover older versions of your files

            It offers its own hosting of shared documents, which includes Jupyter notebooks
            and any other associated data files.
          div.
            Under the hood, #{NAME} uses a novel renderer which generates a static HTML representation on the server side
            and even includes pre-rendered LaTeX formulas.
            This approach does not suffer from the same shortcomings as other solutions based on
            #[a(href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io") nbconvert].
