# Open CoCalc landing page

These are the assets for the open source landing page, which is used
when @cocalc/landing isn't installed.  It's written using pug templates
and the code that actually serves this is in `smc-hub/open-cocalc-server.ts`.

TODO: I [ws] am going to rewrite this using next.js + react...
