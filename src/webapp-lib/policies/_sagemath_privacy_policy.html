    <p>
      <strong>Research and Development.</strong> Sagemath may use Personal

      or in the aggregate with information obtained from other sources, in
      order to help us to optimally deliver our existing products and Services

      set forth below.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Anonymous and Aggregated Information Use.</strong> Sagemath may
      use Personal Information and other information about you to create

      information, de-identified location information, information about the

      a friend or colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use our
      Services. Email addresses that you may provide for a friend or colleague
