{"desc":"## CoCalc is a platform for Collaborative Calculation in the Cloud.\n\nBut what does that mean?\n\nCollaboration means sharing the same environment with anyone by adding them to a project. This allows you to edit the same files, run the same computations, and do all of it from the exact same place (and even at the same time).\n\nBeing in the cloud means each of your projects is available on the internet which you can access any time, from any modern browser, on any computer.\n\n- Got a new device? Just slap on your favorite browser and log right in. No installs necessary.\n\n- Want to share some data analysis you wrote in Python or R? Don't worry about your friend having the right environment, just invite them to the project or share a public link with them.\n\n### File Creation\n\nBack to the tutorial, let's start with something simple:\n\n- [ ] Create a file named `hello_world.md`\n\nThere are a few ways to do this.
