The schema below determines the PostgreSQL database schema.   The notation is as follows:

schema.table_name =
    desc: 'A description of this table.'   # will be used only for tooling
    primary_key : 'the_table_primary_key'
    durability :  'hard' or 'soft' # optional -- if given, specify the table durability; 'hard' is the default
    fields :   # every field *must* be listed here or user queries won't work.
        the_table_primary_key :
            type : 'uuid'
            desc : 'This is the primary key of the table.'
        ...
    pg_indexes : [array of column names]  # also some more complicated ways to define indexes; see the examples.
    user_query :  # queries that are directly exposed to the client via a friendly "fill in what result looks like" query language
        get :     # describes get query for reading data from this table
            pg_where :  # this gets run first on the table before
                      'account_id' - replaced by user's account_id
                      'project_id' - filled in by project_id, which must be specified in the query itself;
                                    (if table not anonymous then project_id must be a project that user has read access to)
                      'project_id-public' - filled in by project_id, which must be specified in the query itself;
                                    (if table not anonymous then project_id must be of a project with at east one public path)
                      'all_projects_read' - filled in with list of all the id's of projects this user has read access to
                      'collaborators' - filled in by account_id's of all collaborators of this user
                      an arbitrary function -  gets called with an object with these keys:
                             account_id, table, query, multi, options, changes
            fields :  # these are the fields any user is allowed to see, subject to the all constraint above
                field_name    : either null or a default_value
                another_field : 10   # means will default to 10 if undefined in database
                this_field    : null # no default filled in
                settings :
                     strip : false   # defaults for a field that is an object -- these get filled in if missing in db
                     wrap  : true
        set :     # describes more dangerous *set* queries that the user can make via the query language
            pg_where :   # initially restrict what user can set
                'account_id' - user account_id
                      - list of project_id's that the user has write access to
            fields :    # user must always give the primary key in set queries
                account_id : 'account_id'  # means that this field will automatically be filled in with account_id
                project_id : 'project_write' # means that this field *must* be a project_id that the user has *write* access to
                foo : true   # user is allowed (but not required) to set this
                bar : true   # means user is allowed to set this

To specify more than one user query against a table, make a new table as above, omitting
everything except the user_query section, and include a virtual section listing the actual
table to query:

    virtual : 'original_table'

For example,

schema.collaborators =
    primary_key : 'account_id'
    anonymous   : false
    virtual     : 'accounts'
    user_query:
        get : ...


Finally, putting

    anonymous : true

makes it so non-signed-in-users may query the table (read only) for data, e.g.,

schema.stats =
    primary_key: 'id'
    anonymous : true   # allow user access, even if not signed in
    fields:
        id                  : true
        ...
