/* TODO: for postgres rewrite after done we MIGHT completely redo file_use to eliminate
the id field, use project_id, path as a compound primary key, and maybe put users in
another table with a relation.  There is also expert discussion about this table in the
Hacker News discussion of my PostgreSQL vs ... blog post.
