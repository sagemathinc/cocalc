Table that enables set queries to the course field of a project.  Only

it possible for the owner of the project to set things, but not for the
collaborators to set those things.
**wARNING:** right now we're not using this since when multiple people add
students to a course and the 'course' field doesn't get properly set,
much confusion and misery arises.... and it is very hard to fix.
In theory a malicous student could not pay via this.  But if they could
mess with their client, they could easily not pay anyways.

Table that enables any signed-in user to set an invite request.
Later: we can make an index so that users can see all outstanding requests they have made easily.
How to test this from the browser console:
   project_id = '4e0f5bfd-3f1b-4d7b-9dff-456dcf8725b8' // id of a project you have
   invite_requests = {}; invite_requests[smc.client.account_id] = {timestamp:new Date(), message:'please invite me'}
   smc.client.query({cb:console.log, query:{project_invite_requests:{project_id:project_id, invite_requests:invite_requests}}})  // set it
   smc.redux.getStore('projects').get_project(project_id).invite_requests                 // see requests for this project

CURRENTLY NOT USED, but probably will be...

database._user_set_query_project_invite_requests(old_val, new_val, account_id, cb)
 For now don't check anything -- this is how we will make it secure later.
 This will:
   - that user setting this is signed in
   - ensure user only modifies their own entry (for their own id).
   - enforce some hard limit on number of outstanding invites (say 30).
   - enforce limit on size of invite message.
   - sanity check on timestamp
   - with an index as mentioned above we could limit the number of projects
     to which a single user has requested to be invited.
