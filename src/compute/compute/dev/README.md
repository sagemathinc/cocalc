This is helpful for developing the compute\-server manager, which is defined in this package.

1. Create the directory /home/user and make sure you can read it.  Maybe even mount it from the target project.

2. Make the conf directory exist here, with the same files as on /cocalc/conf in an actual compute\-server

3. Type `./go.sh` to then make this be the compute manager for some target project.
